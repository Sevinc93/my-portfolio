            <h1>Hey there! I'm Sevinc</h1>
            <p>Little about me:</p>
            </header>
            <p>I studied Translation and Interpretation in Cyprus. I have always dreamt of going to the United States. That was one of my craziest dream of mine. I was living my best life over there. Working and traveling, that's what I do there. Sounds amazing right? I know. After came back I decided to learn Spanish. So once I gratuated I packed up little things then go to Málaga, Spain. I had ana amazing three months there. Travelled three states. Learn a lot and had the chance to meet incredible people from all over the World. So do you think I stop? Of course not. I kept travelling and working around Europe. I was working in the United Kingdom just for a short time. Then I moved to sunny Lisbon,Portugal. I have worked there almost 2 years and before I quit my job there I go to Toronto,Canada to see Niagara Falls. It was another incredible experience of mine. After 2 years I started a new job t Apple in Cork,Ireland. Such a privilege to work there but I have so much eager to see the world. Another adventure? Yes. I touched down to Australia and I spent 6 months down there.</p>
